Added Shopsanity support (thanks to 461weavile for putting that together)\
Split Goldenrod Department Store into a separate location (Goldenrod too OP)\

Added UnownDex\
Added "Nerf Ho-oh" modifier, where Ho-oh (and subsequently Ho-oh chamber) will be available without beating E4\
Added Leftovers to all modes (I didn't bother with a modifier, because even if it's unrandomized, it's probably worth people grabbing anyway)\

Example: Extreme + Hidden Items can now be made by clicking the Extreme preset, then clicking the Hidden Items modifier.\
